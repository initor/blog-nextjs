## Welcome to Preview

This is a sample preview post. It demonstrates how the preview section works:

- **Hidden from navigation**: This post won't appear in the main site navigation
- **Direct URL access only**: Users need the exact URL to view this content
- **Same look and feel**: Uses the same styling as regular blog posts
- **Preview badge**: Notice the "Preview" badge indicating this is a draft

### Use Cases

The preview section is perfect for:

1. Sharing draft posts with reviewers before publishing
2. Testing new content layouts
3. Getting feedback on work-in-progress articles

### Moving to Production

When you're ready to publish a preview post, simply move the `.mdx` file from `src/content/preview/` to `src/content/blog/`.

Happy writing!
