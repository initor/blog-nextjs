# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post using Next.js and MDX. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.

## Why Next.js and MDX?

I chose Next.js for its powerful features and MDX for its flexibility in writing content. Here are some things I love about this setup:

- Write content in Markdown
- Embed React components
- Great developer experience
- Fast page loads
- Easy deployment

## What's Next?

I plan to write about:
1. Web development
2. Software engineering
3. Tech insights
4. Personal projects

Stay tuned for more content!
