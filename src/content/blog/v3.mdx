Welcome to Version 3.0 of my blog. I've rebuilt it from scratch with a new stack.

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) runs the site, handling routing and rendering. I write posts in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com), which lets me use both Markdown and React components. The code is in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) to catch errors early and make maintenance easier.

[Vercel](https://vercel.com) automatically deploys from my [GitHub](https://github.com) repository and handles the hosting. It manages SSL and performance without extra configuration.

Time to start writing!
