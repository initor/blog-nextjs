Hello, world!

Introducing my personal blog **Initial**.

Topics here can be expected to be arbitrary from ancient yeti to state of the art web development technical discussions.

With that being said, this blog is customized based on the default [Jekyll][Jekyll] blogging project and is hosted on [GitHub][GitHub]. Besides refactoring the user interface to a minimal monochrome look-and-feel, I have completely rewritten the homepage with [AngularJS][AngularJS] making it support infinite-scroll and instant search across all posts.

Hope you enjoy! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰
